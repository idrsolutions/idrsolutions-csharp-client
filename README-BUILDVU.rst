IDRSolutions C# Client with BuildVu
=======================================

Convert PDF to HTML5 or SVG with C#, using the IDRSolutions C# Client to
interact with IDRsolutions' `BuildVu Microservice Example`_.

The BuildVu Microservice Example is an open source project that allows you to
convert PDF to HTML5 or SVG by running `BuildVu`_ as an online service.

IDR Solutions offer a free trial service for running BuildVu with C#, 
more infomation on this can be found `here.`_

--------------

Installation
------------

Using Nuget:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    $ nuget install idrsolutions_csharp_client


--------------

Usage
-----

Basic:
~~~~~~

First, import IDRCloudClient and setup the converter details by creating a new
``IDRCloudClient`` object :

::

    using idrsolutions_csharp_client;
	IDRCloudClient client = new IDRCloudClient('http://localhost:8080/' + IDRCloudClient.BUILDVU);


Next you need to create the conversion parameters :

::

	Dictionary<string, string> parameters = new Dictionary<string, string>
	{
		["input"] = IDRCloudClient.UPLOAD,
		["file"] = "path/to/input.pdf"
	};


Alternatively, you can specify a url from which the server will download the 
file to convert.

::

	Dictionary<string, string> parameters = new Dictionary<string, string>
	{
		["input"] = IDRCloudClient.DOWNLOAD,
		["url"] = "http://link.to/filename"
	};


Finally you can perform the conversion and download the results with the following : 

::

	// conversionResults are the values from the servers response
	Dictionary<string, string> conversionResults = client.Convert(parameters);

	// You can also specify a directory to download the converted output to:
	client.DownloadResult(conversionResults, "path/to/output/dir");


Additional parameters can be used in ``convert()``, they are defined in our 
`API`_

--------------

Changes for docker version
--------------------------

If your BuildVu service requires authentication, you can set the username and password by passing an additional tuple argument as shown below :
::

    using idrsolutions_csharp_client;
    client = IDRCloudClient("http://localhost:8080/" + IDRCloudClient.BUILDVU, "username", "password")
